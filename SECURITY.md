## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you are aware of any security vulnerabilities, we encourage you to create an issue under the issues tab. 

Please try to provide a detailed description of the bug/bugs reported, including the steps needed to reproduce the issue along with any code samples or screenshots that you would like to share. More precise bug reports will help us move forward much faster. Additionally, please avoid reporting bugs that already have open issues. Take a moment to search the issue list of the related GitHub repositories before creating a new issue.

Allow a reasonable timeframe for Seagate to address the issue and release a patch.
